            <img src="rice.JPG" alt="My cat Rice" width="200"> 
            <p id="hidden-text1" class="hidden">I learned about the CSS `filter` property. It allows us to apply visual effects like 
                grayscale, blur, and brightness to images. I used `grayscale(100%) brightness(120%)` to 
                make my cat image appear black & white and slightly brighter, then added a hover effect 
                to restore the original colors smoothly. This makes the page feel more interactive!</p>
            <button id="reveal-btn1">Reveal Hidden Text1</button>
            <p>This is my cat Rice, she is three years old, I adopted her when she was 2 month, she has been the best company!</p>

                <p>Rice loves to chase after laser pointers, and enjoys watching birds through the window!</p>

            <p id="hidden-text2" class="hidden">I learned about the 'details' and 'summary' elements. 
                'details' lets me create a section that expands when clicked, and 'summary' is its clickable title. 
                This is useful for hiding extra information until the user wants to see it, making the webpage cleaner and interactive! </p>
